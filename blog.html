                    </h2>
                    <p> is a compact automobile that has been manufactured since 1992 by Subaru. Subaru introduced the Impreza as a replacement for the Leone, with the Leone's EA series engines replaced by the newer EJ series versions.</p>
<p>Now in its fourth generation, Subaru has offered four-door sedan and five-door hatchback body variants since 1992; the firm also offered a coupe from 1995 until 2000. Mainstream versions have received naturally aspirated "boxer" flat-four engines ranging from 1.5- to 2.5-liters, with the performance-oriented Impreza WRX and WRX STI models uprated with the addition of turbochargers.</p>
<p>Since the third generation series, some markets have adopted the abbreviated Subaru WRX name for these high-performance variants. The first three generations of Impreza in North America were also available with an off-road appearance package titled Subaru Outback Sport.</p>

                        <small>(BrZ)</small>
                    </h2>
                    <p>is a rear wheel drive sports coup√© developed as a joint venture between Subaru and Toyota. The BRZ is marketed by Toyota as the GT 86, and by its subsidiary Scion as the FR-S. All three models have the same base platform, but trim levels and body panels vary slightly as befits the differing market segments they are targeted at.</p>
<p>BRZ is the first sports car released by Subaru in recent years not to feature turbocharging, instead being fitted with a 4 cylinder naturally aspirated boxer engine with direct injection technology, outputting 200HP.</p>
<p>Despite this, the focus by Subaru on low centre of gravity, steering and handling makes the BRZ still of interest to the sports car market.</p>
<p>Low weight has also been focused on in the design, with the BRZ weighing only ~1200kg - several hundred kilograms lighter than Subaru's WRX STi models.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>is a mid-size car built by Japanese automobile manufacturer Subaru since 1989. Part of the original design goals for the Legacy model was to provide Subaru a vehicle in which they could compete in the lucrative North American midsize market against competitors Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima. Higher performance variants of the Legacy are offered as competitive alternatives to compact executive cars such as the Audi A4, Alfa Romeo 159 and BMW 3 Series. The Legacy also serves as Subaru's flagship car.</p>
<p>In 1996, a variant of the Legacy with heightened suspension called the Legacy Outback was introduced to compete in the burgeoning sport-utility vehicle class and proved to be a sales success for Subaru.</p> 
<p>The Outback line was split into its own model in 2000, known as the Subaru Outback.</p>
